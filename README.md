# Kanye Says... 🗣️✨

Get ready for some Kanye-level wisdom! This Python gem uses `tkinter` and the Kanye Rest API to serve up random Kanye West quotes with a single click. Paired with a slick background and a Kanye button, it’s a mini shrine to Ye’s wildest words, delivered straight to your screen. Press the button, soak in the genius, repeat!

## Controls 🎮

It’s simple, fam:
- **Click the Kanye Button**: Smack that Kanye icon to fetch a fresh quote from the API.
- **Close the Window**: Done vibin’? Just X out the window to bounce.

One button, infinite Kanye energy, what more do you need?

## Customize It! 🎉

Wanna remix this Kanye magic? Tweak away:
- Swap `background.png` for a wilder pic, maybe Kanye in shades or a neon vibe.
- Trade `kanye.png` for a different Ye pose (keep it PNG, tho!).
- Mess with `font=("Arial", 18, "bold")`—try "Helvetica" or bump it to 24 for extra swagger.
- Adjust `width=250` in the text to fit longer rants or tighten it up.

Make it your own, Kanye would respect the hustle!

## Why’d I Make This?

Because Kanye’s a mood, and I wanted to bottle that chaos in code! Mixing `tkinter` with a free API felt like the perfect way to sprinkle some Ye wisdom into the world. It’s quick, it’s quirky, and it’s a lil’ tribute to the man who’s always got somethin’ to say.
